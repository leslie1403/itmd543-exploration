# ITMD543 Framework Exploration Assignment 

## Project Description
This is a web application that demonstrates what is offered by an event planning department, specifically the one at Illinois Tech. It is a more condensed version as it only shows a fraction of what actually is offered by them. It focuses on different components of events, such as venues and equipment. There is a total of 3 pages, the upcoming events page, the venues page, and the services page. 
- The upcoming events page shows a few upcoming events to help clients have the opporutnitu of vistiing the venue while in use. 
- The venues page shows different spaces within an on-campus building with a short description and image. 
- The services page has subsections that go more in depth as to the equipment, AV, and catering that is provided by the department per client request .
